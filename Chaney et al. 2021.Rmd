This first analysis uses data that I got directly from the publication.
```{r}
#change the path to whatever the path for the file you have on your computer!!
chaney <- read.csv("/Users/jonathanpertile/Downloads/chaney-data-from-publication.csv")
#this is the data copied from the paper directly
kable(chaney)
```

# T-test between methods
```{r}
# Paired t-test
chaney.t.test <- t.test(chaney$Clean.catch.raw.mean, chaney$Cotton.raw..STD...μg.ml.1., paired = TRUE)

# Print the result
print(chaney.t.test)
```

# Effect size between methods

```{r}
abs_diff <- abs(chaney$Raw.difference..μg.ml.1.)


#Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the differences
mean_diff <- mean(abs_diff)
sd_diff <- sd(abs_diff)

# Calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM)
sem_diff <- sd_diff / sqrt(length(abs_diff))

# Degrees of freedom for a one-sample t-test
df <- length(abs_diff) - 1

# Calculate the margin of error
margin_of_error <- qt(0.975, df) * sem_diff

# Calculate the confidence interval
confidence_interval <- c(mean_diff - margin_of_error, mean_diff + margin_of_error)

# Print the result
print(paste0("Effect size: ", round(mean_diff, 2), "; CI: (", round(confidence_interval[1],2), ", ",  round(confidence_interval[2],2), ")"))

```


# Using dataset sent from Carlye

Now I am using the dataset sent directly from Carlye that includes data on each replicate.

```{r}
Chaney2 <- read.csv("//Users/jonathanpertile/Downloads/chaney-data-from-chaney.csv")
Chaney2 <- Chaney2[-c(4, 12),] #dropping the pair with an observation that has too high of a CV
# I also added dropped the 12th row, which was empty
kable(Chaney2, digits = 1)
```
