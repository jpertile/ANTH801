# ANTH801

Here you can find the supplementerary information for my Anth801 final project. Read this for information about each file.

## Appendix
The appendix includes further information on the data collection protocol.

## S1
The Reproducability Documentation table is an excel sheet including details on what to evaluate while reproducing each study. Metadata is included on the second sheet.

## S2
The Reproduced Results table contains a summary of reproduced results and the original published values. Metadata is included on the second sheet. 

## S3
Chaney-data-from-publication is the data I extracted from Chaney et al. 2021's published results. 

## S4
Chaney-data-from-Chaney is the data I recieved from Chaney to complete my reproducability analysis.

## S5 & S6

The Chaney-et-al. files include my code used to reproduce Chaney et al. 2021. The html file can be viewed in a browser, but must be downloaded first (do not attempt to read it in github). The rmd file is an r-markdown file, which can be read in R.  Both Chaney data files must be downloaded to your device to run the code in R. PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU CHANGE THE PATH NAMES TO THE CORRECT PATH NAME FOR YOUR DEVICE OR THE CODE WILL FAIL. The pathnames are set to run using my own device at the moment. If you run into too much trouble with this, just download the html file and view the code there instead.

## S7

Corley-data-from-publication is the data shared with the Corley et al. 2021's published article.

## S8 & S9

The Corley-et-al. files include my code used to reproduce Corley et al. 2021. The rmd file is an r-markdown file, which can be read in R. The html file can be viewed in a browser, but must be downloaded first (do not attempt to read it in github). The corley data file must be downloaded to your device to run the code in R.
